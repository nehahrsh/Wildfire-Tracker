# Wildfire-Tracker

#### This project is loosely inspired by a [rainfall map](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c71a1dd44f9b0532bacf43ac379ab33d) I created on Google Earth Engine for the 2022 Pakistan floods that destroyed millions of rural settlements. This Wildfire Tracker Web App visualizes wildfires across California and other regions by tracking them through a NASA API and plotting them on a Google Map, while providing specific regional information and event IDs.

## Built With
#### React (https://react.dev)
#### NASA EONET API (https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1)

## Overview
#### Users can view the complete map as soon as they access the web app, which displays plotted wildfires across the region in frame. To learn more about each event, users can click on the fire icon to view a pop up on the top right of the screen that displays the event location and ID from the NASA database.
