# Wildfire-Tracker

#### This project is loosely inspired by a [rainfall map](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c71a1dd44f9b0532bacf43ac379ab33d) I created on Google Earth Engine for the 2022 Pakistan floods that wiped out millions of rural settlements. This Wildfire Tracker Web App is built using React and powered by the NASA EONET API to visualize wildfire data across California, with responsive functionality and specific information on each disaster event.
