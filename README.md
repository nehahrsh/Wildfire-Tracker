# Wildfire Tracker

#### This project is loosely inspired by the [rainfall map](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c71a1dd44f9b0532bacf43ac379ab33d) I built on Google Earth Engine for the disastrous floods in Pakistan in 2022 brought on by climate change. This Wildfire Tracker visualizes wildfires across California by tracking them through a NASA API and plotting them on a Google map, while providing specific locations and event IDs.

## Built With
#### React 
#### NASA EONET API
