# Wildfire-Tracker

#### This project is loosely inspired by a [rainfall map](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c71a1dd44f9b0532bacf43ac379ab33d) I created on Google Earth Engine for the 2022 Pakistan floods that wiped out millions of rural settlements. This Wildfire Tracker Web App visualizes wildfires across California and other regions by tracking them through a NASA API and plotting them on a Google Map, while providing specific regional information and event IDs.

## Built With
#### React (https://react.dev)
#### NASA EONET API (https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v2.1)
